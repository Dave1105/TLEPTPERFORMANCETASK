 <b> <center> <font face= "courier", color= "#A52A2A", size= "4">During in this time of pandemic, we do not live without relationships and we should never forget that<br><br>
 We have a very caring and shared connection between us<br><br>
 And it’s amazing to see how we stick together at times<br><br>
 Sharing is caring, Sometimes we need to remember how important kindness is<br><br>
 We need to remember that we have been given a gift called life and that we should appreciate it.<br><br>
 The things we did on a daily basis.<br><br><br><br>
 The lockdown has made us realise the importance of actually appreciating the things and people<br><br>
 that we take for granted, but what it has taught us is the spirit of togetherness and giving a<br><br>
 helping to others and helping where one can.<br><br>
 Everything can end tomorrow, Focus on what is important to us, When all this is over, Earth<br><br>
 Will continue to spin, and life will flow again, The question is whether by then we will have<br><br>
 Learned our lesson, Let us be mindful of our Earth and it will be kind to us. There is no<br><br>
 Rainbow without rain, Remember that.<br><br><br><br>

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic loss of human life worldwide and presents an unprecedented challenge<br><br>
To public health, food systems and the world of work.<br><br>
The economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic<br><br>
Is devastating: tens of millions of people are at risk of falling into extreme poverty,<br><br>
While the number of undernourished people, currently estimated at nearly 690 million,<br><br>
Could increase by up to 132 million by the end of the year.<br><br><br><br>
COVID-19 has rapidly affected our day to day life, businesses, disrupted the world trade and <br><br>
movements. Identification of the disease at an early stage is vital to control the spread of the<br><br> 
virus because it very rapidly spreads from person to person. Most of the countries have slowed <br><br>
down their manufacturing of the products. The various industries and sectors are affected <br><br>
by the cause of this disease; these include the pharmaceuticals industry, solar power sector, <br><br>
tourism, Information and electronics industry. This virus creates significant knock-on effects <br><br>
on the daily life of citizens, as well as about the global economy.<br><br><br><br>

<font face= "optima", color= "2F4F4F", size= "4"><b>“Have no anxiety at all; but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, make your requests known to God.” (Philippians 4:6)<br><br>
Loving God, we arise today to face the challenges on the road ahead.  It is clear that our<br><br>
current situation needs us to be steadfast and persistent in our response to COVID-19; as<br><br>
this is a marathon, not a sprint.  Be with us now O Lord!<br><br><br>
Loving father during your Ministry on earth Your sign was the healing you shared with us,<br><br>
and Your promise to take away our anxieties the symbol of your eternal presence.<br><br><br>
Be present to Your people who suffer and allow them to feel your healing touch through the<br><br>
compassionate care of our Doctors, nurses and caregivers.  Remove any fear, feelings of<br><br>
anxiousness, or uncertainties from our hearts.  Let us trust in You.  Protect our friends,<br><br>
families and coworkers and bring Your peace to all who support us.<br><br><br>
Give us your Grace O Lord so we can speak calmly, clearly and truthfully with each other. <br><br>
Let us see one another as You see us.  May truth, empathy and kindness remain our<br><br>
steadfast rock!  Give spouses a patient and compassion place for each other.  Be with worn-<br><br>
out parents and give them Your love so that they may speak words of kindness and<br><br>
encouragement to their children.  Be with us now, O Lord!<br><br><br>
Let us sanitize more and pray more.  Let us be kinder than we have to in adversity.  Let us<br><br>
speak warmer that we need to in duress.  Let us act more compassionately than we should<br><br>
do with others…and let us start and end each day on our knees, enraptured with a loving<br><br>
God, who by prayer and petition, in thanksgiving, we make every request known, too!  Be<br><br>
with us now O Lord!</b>
